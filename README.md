Hey!

Thanks for showing interest in my small project.

The aim is an idle game, the theme is racing a car around a track. You can check out the current state of the project on your own computer by cloning this repo, or by visiting [the live version of it](farkasma.github.io/idle-racing).

This is mostly just a learning project for JavaScript for me, and the main reason it's on GitHub at all is because of the site hosting possibility.

Any ideas or feedback is very welcome! :)
